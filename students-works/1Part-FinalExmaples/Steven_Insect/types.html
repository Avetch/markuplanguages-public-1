                <h4>Ant</h4>
                <p>A small insect that lives under the ground in large organized groups called colonies.
                    Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.[4][5] They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.</br></p>

                <h4>Aphid</h4>
                <p>A very small insect that lives on plants and destroys them. Aphids seem to find their way into every garden. They are small, soft-bodied insects that can survive in almost any zone. Aphids multiply quickly, so try to control them before reproduction starts. Many generations can occur in one season. The good news is that they tend to move rather slowly and aphid control is relatively easy.</p>

                <h4>Bedbug</h4>
                <p>Here's how to perform a DIY bed bug check. You will quickly learn how to tell if your home has been invaded and how to treat bed bug bites if you have them. Once you confirm the infestation has begun, remember that the main goal is to end it even quicker.</p>

                <h4>Bee</h4>
                <p>Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.[1][2] They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>

                <h4>Beetle</h4>
                <p>Beetles are the most common type of insect.  Beetles are everywhere.  But beetles can be confused with other kinds of insects, especially some true bugs.  So how do you recognize a beetle?
                    
                    First look for the wings and wing covers.  Most insects have wings, and those that do have two pairs.  Beetles differ from all other winged insects by having the first pair of wings hardened and thickened.  These hard forewings serve as a protective shield for the fragile flying wings, which are folded underneath.  In fact the Latin name for this order, Coleoptera, means “folded wing”.  Wing covers in beetles meet in a straight line down the middle of the back  [the simplest test for a beetle is the one invented by school boys long ago–if it crunches when you step on it, it was probably a beetle (wing covers are brittle)–but let’s not].</p>
